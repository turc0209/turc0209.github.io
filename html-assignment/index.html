        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an artist with a passion for video games and comic books! I have plans for making my own video game and comic books. It's a <strong>ton</strong> of work and it's slow going but I know I'll make it happen! My 1<sup>st</sup> favourite thing is designing my own characters. I <em>love</em> refining an idea of a character and imagining what their story is. I'm sure it's no surprise at this point that I'm kind of a nerd. I have a pretty serious Pokemon card collection and I was learning Japanese for a few years!</p>
        <p>I am in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program here at Algonquin College after having completed a bachelor's degree in psychology from uOttawa. Unfortunately, that field needs at least a master's degree to get a job and I was no longer interested in pursuing that. I'd also gone to Sheridan College for an introductory art program, and while part of me still wants to pursue illustration and animation, I think jobs in those fields are unstable and low-paying. I'd rather pursue those in my personal time. Graphic design, user experience design, and maybe even web development are, I think, a great balance of creativity and more lucrative ways to make a living.</p>
